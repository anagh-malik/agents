    "- Once you've signed up, on the home screen, click \"Create an Application/API Token\", and give it any name. Then, click *Create Application*.\n",
    "- After that, add 2 lines to your `.env` file that you have.\n",
    "  - `PUSHOVER_USER=`*put the key that's on the top right of your Pushover home screen, starts with a **u***\n",
    "  - `PUSHOVER_TOKEN=`*put the key that shows up when you click into your new application called <whatever you named it>, the key starts with an **a***\n",
    "- Finally, after you have saved your `.env` and loaded it in *python*, click \"Add Phone, Table or Desktop\" to install on your phone.\n"

It specifies the model you want to use, the messages that form the conversation (in this case, \"Hi, how are you\"), and whether the response should stream back one word at a time or all at once (False here means all at once).\n",

    "- `reply = data['choices'][0]['message']['content']`: This line navigates through the nested dictionary structure of the data to extract the AI's actual reply. It finds the first choice from the model and pulls out the text content of the message.\n",
