    "- An AI agent is a computer program that can observe its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve a goal.\n",
    "### 2. Where are they used?\n",
    "1. Chatbots & Virtual Assistants\n",
    "- Example: Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT\n",
    "- They understand your requests and respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Self-Driving Cars\n",
    "- AI agents sense the environment, make decisions, and drive safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Video Games\n",
    "- Non-player characters (NPCs) use AI agents to act smartly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Robotics\n",
    "- Robots in factories or homes decide what to do next.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Recommendation Systems\n",
    "- Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon use AI agents to suggest videos or products.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finance & Trading\n",
    "- AI agents decide when to buy or sell stocks.\n",
